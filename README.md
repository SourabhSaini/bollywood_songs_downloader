# bollywood_songs_downloader
This is very simple web scraping based python 3 which can download latest songs from a website(hardcoded) and will save it to music folder in Ubuntu. It can work for windows also, but after some modifications. I have not tested it in Windows yet.

For downloading all songs of latest movies automatically, type in terminal:

$python3 songs.py

and boom...it will download all songs one  by one to music directory.
